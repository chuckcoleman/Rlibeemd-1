# Introduction

Installing `Rlibeemd` is straightforward. For Windows and OSX systems you can install the binary package from CRAN in usual way. For source packages, the `libeemd` requires Gnu Scientific Library (`GSL`), so we need to install that first if we don't already have it in our system. Luckily that is straighforward in Linux (see below). 

These notes provide detailed instructions for installing `libeemd` itself especially on Windows environment. Note that if want to install `Rlibeemd` from source on Windows environment, you can also 

# Linux (and OS X?)

On Linux, we first install `GSL` (if not already present). For example in Ubuntu:
```{bash, eval = FALSE }
sudo apt-get install libgsl2 libgsl-dev
```

And then you can just use `install.packages("Rlibeemd")` in R elevant version number). Or, more preferably use the OpenMP-supported version from GitHub: `devtools::install_github("helske/Rlibeemd")`.

# Windows

Again, we first need to install `GSL`. Download the appropriate GSL files from here: https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies/multilib/ (file `local323.zip` or equivalent), and then you need to add environmental variable `LIB_GSL=<path/to/gsl>`. And proceed as in Linux case.
